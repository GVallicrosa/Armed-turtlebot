Current status:

Simpifying the mission control (and motionControl) node.
The plan is to have all of this completed for Monday 19th November.

I will be working on this all day on Thursday (today), Saturday and Sunday.

Todo:

Make sure controller nodes implement 'belief_XXX' publishers for
the mission control (mc) node to listen out for. See mc.py for details.
